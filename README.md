# De-Chorder

First commit.
prototype_1 includes a scale generator.

What works:
- Currently can generate major and minor scales with input from user about root note and type of scale.
- For custom scales, make a new global array with scale in the form of W,H notes. 
  Then add that condition in scale_builder function, and the print functions.

Future:
- Chord generator
- Common progression generator
- Music to MIDI conversion
- Chord suggestion
- GUI
